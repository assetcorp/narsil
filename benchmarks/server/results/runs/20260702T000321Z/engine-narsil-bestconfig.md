## Vector track

- Embedding model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dim, cosine)
- Index setup: HNSW over the shared precomputed vectors, SQ8 scalar quantization with full-precision rerank, cosine
- Operating point: search knob tuned to ann_recall@10 >= 0.99 against exact kNN over the same vectors

Retrieval quality vs human judgements:

| Dataset | nDCG@10 | Recall@100 | MAP | MRR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| beir/scifact/test | 0.6239 | 0.9227 | 0.5797 | 0.5849 |
| beir/nfcorpus/test | 0.3145 | 0.3094 | 0.1575 | 0.5168 |

Recall operating point (latency below is measured here, the matched-recall rule for ANN search):

| Dataset | Knob | Value | ANN recall@k | Target met | Secondary value | Secondary recall |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| beir/scifact/test | efSearch | 64 | 0.9967 | yes | 16 | 0.9607 |
| beir/nfcorpus/test | efSearch | 128 | 0.9950 | yes | 32 | 0.9579 |

Latency is measured at the operating point.

Operational metrics. Latency below is the engine's own reported query time (server-side); the client round-trip is reported separately underneath.

| Dataset | Docs | Ingest docs/s | Build s | Index size | Server p50 ms | Server p95 ms | Server p99 ms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| beir/scifact/test | 5183 | 300 | 17.30 | 37.8 MB | 0.38 | 0.47 | 0.51 |
| beir/nfcorpus/test | 3633 | 463 | 7.84 | 27.4 MB | 0.51 | 0.62 | 0.75 |

Client round-trip latency (wall-clock around the HTTP call, includes transport and JSON), measured over the same queries and repeats:

| Dataset | Client p50 ms | Client p95 ms | Client p99 ms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| beir/scifact/test | 4.62 | 4.89 | 5.12 |
| beir/nfcorpus/test | 4.76 | 5.16 | 5.49 |

Server-side time source per dataset:

- beir/scifact/test: response `elapsed` field (floating-millisecond resolution)
- beir/nfcorpus/test: response `elapsed` field (floating-millisecond resolution)

beir/scifact/test throughput:

Throughput under concurrent load (closed-loop; QPS = completed queries / elapsed). Per-request latency here is measured under that load, separate from the serial latency above. Client-limited marks a level where the harness, not the engine, capped the rate:

| Concurrency | QPS | Errors | Under-load p95 ms | Achieved concurrency | Client-limited |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | 270 | 0 | 99.62 | 15.7 | no |

beir/nfcorpus/test throughput:

Throughput under concurrent load (closed-loop; QPS = completed queries / elapsed). Per-request latency here is measured under that load, separate from the serial latency above. Client-limited marks a level where the harness, not the engine, capped the rate:

| Concurrency | QPS | Errors | Under-load p95 ms | Achieved concurrency | Client-limited |

## Hybrid track

- Setup: BM25 (text) fused with SQ8-quantized HNSW vector search (full-precision rerank) via Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- Fusion: RRF (k=60)

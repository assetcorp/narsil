## Keyword track

Retrieval quality vs Anserini BM25 reference:

| Dataset | nDCG@10 | Reference | Delta | Status | Recall@100 | MAP | MRR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| beir/scifact/test | 0.3728 | 0.6790 | -0.3062 | outside margin | 0.3923 | 0.3659 | 0.3784 |
| beir/nfcorpus/test | 0.1817 | 0.3220 | -0.1403 | outside margin | 0.1123 | 0.0839 | 0.3372 |

Operational metrics. Latency below is the engine's own reported query time (server-side); the client round-trip is reported separately underneath.

| Dataset | Docs | Ingest docs/s | Build s | Index size | Server p50 ms | Server p95 ms | Server p99 ms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| beir/scifact/test | 5183 | 2042 | 2.54 | n/a | 12.00 | 57.00 | 98.00 |
| beir/nfcorpus/test | 3633 | 3432 | 1.06 | n/a | 0.00 | 4.00 | 10.00 |

Client round-trip latency (wall-clock around the HTTP call, includes transport and JSON), measured over the same queries and repeats:

| Dataset | Client p50 ms | Client p95 ms | Client p99 ms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| beir/scifact/test | 13.80 | 58.99 | 99.25 |
| beir/nfcorpus/test | 0.76 | 6.32 | 12.05 |

Server-side time source per dataset:

- beir/scifact/test: response `search_time_ms` field (integer-millisecond resolution; sub-millisecond searches floor to 0-1 ms)
- beir/nfcorpus/test: response `search_time_ms` field (integer-millisecond resolution; sub-millisecond searches floor to 0-1 ms)

beir/scifact/test throughput:

Throughput under concurrent load (closed-loop; QPS = completed queries / elapsed). Per-request latency here is measured under that load, separate from the serial latency above. Client-limited marks a level where the harness, not the engine, capped the rate:

| Concurrency | QPS | Errors | Under-load p95 ms | Achieved concurrency | Client-limited |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | 269 | 0 | 179.62 | 15.6 | no |

beir/nfcorpus/test throughput:

Throughput under concurrent load (closed-loop; QPS = completed queries / elapsed). Per-request latency here is measured under that load, separate from the serial latency above. Client-limited marks a level where the harness, not the engine, capped the rate:

| Concurrency | QPS | Errors | Under-load p95 ms | Achieved concurrency | Client-limited |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | 1781 | 0 | 18.59 | 15.9 | no |

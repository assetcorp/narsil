## Keyword track

Retrieval quality vs Anserini BM25 reference:

| Dataset | nDCG@10 | Reference | Delta | Status | Recall@100 | MAP | MRR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | 0.6781 | 0.6790 | -0.0009 | within margin | 0.9320 | 0.6379 | 0.6456 |

Operational metrics. Latency below is the engine's own reported query time (server-side); the client round-trip is reported separately underneath.

| Dataset | Docs | Ingest docs/s | Build s | Index size | Server p50 ms | Server p95 ms | Server p99 ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | 5183 | 5209 | 0.99 | 17.8 MB | 0.45 | 0.88 | 1.18 |

Client round-trip latency (wall-clock around the HTTP call, includes transport and JSON), measured over the same queries and repeats:

| Dataset | Client p50 ms | Client p95 ms | Client p99 ms |
|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | 0.81 | 1.29 | 1.59 |

Server-side time source per dataset:

- beir/scifact/test: response `elapsed` field (floating-millisecond resolution)

## Vector track

- Embedding model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dim, cosine)
- Index setup: HNSW over the shared precomputed vectors, full precision (SQ8 quantization off), cosine
- Operating point: search knob tuned to ann_recall@10 >= 0.99 against exact kNN over the same vectors

Retrieval quality vs human judgements:

| Dataset | nDCG@10 | Recall@100 | MAP | MRR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | 0.6239 | 0.9227 | 0.5797 | 0.5849 |

Recall operating point (latency below is measured here, the matched-recall rule for ANN search):

| Dataset | Knob | Value | ANN recall@k | Target met | Secondary value | Secondary recall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | efSearch | 64 | 0.9967 | yes | 16 | 0.9617 |

Latency is measured at the operating point.

Operational metrics. Latency below is the engine's own reported query time (server-side); the client round-trip is reported separately underneath.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | 5183 | 640 | 8.10 | 33.9 MB | 0.42 | 0.59 | 0.86 |

Client round-trip latency (wall-clock around the HTTP call, includes transport and JSON), measured over the same queries and repeats:

| Dataset | Client p50 ms | Client p95 ms | Client p99 ms |
|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | 2.59 | 3.08 | 3.80 |

Server-side time source per dataset:

- beir/scifact/test: response `elapsed` field (floating-millisecond resolution)

## Hybrid track

- Setup: BM25 (text) fused with HNSW vector search via Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- Fusion: RRF (k=60)

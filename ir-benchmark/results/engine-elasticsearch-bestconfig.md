# elasticsearch retrieval (keyword, vector, hybrid, best-config vector profile)

## Environment

- Captured: 2026-06-29T14:54:05.362552+00:00
- OS / arch: Linux 6.12.76-linuxkit / aarch64 (containerized: True)
- CPU: aarch64 (7 logical)
- Memory: 9.4 GB
- Memory cap per engine: 8.6 GB
- Tracks: keyword, vector, hybrid
- Keyword setup: BM25 k1=0.9 b=0.4 (custom default similarity); Elasticsearch `english` analyzer (Porter stemmer, English stop words)
- Run depth: 1000; run tag: elasticsearch_bm25

## Vector track

- Embedding model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dim, cosine)
- Index setup: dense_vector BBQ (bbq_hnsw, binary quantization) with full-precision rescore (oversample tuned to the recall target), similarity cosine
- Operating point: search knob tuned to ann_recall@10 >= 0.99 against exact kNN over the same vectors

Retrieval quality vs human judgements:

| Dataset | nDCG@10 | Recall@100 | MAP | MRR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | 0.6239 | 0.9227 | 0.5797 | 0.5849 |

Recall operating point (latency below is measured here, the matched-recall rule for ANN search):

| Dataset | Knob | Value | ANN recall@k | Target met | Secondary value | Secondary recall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | num_candidates | 512 | 0.9960 | yes | 128 | 0.9507 |

Latency is measured at the operating point.

Operational metrics. Latency below is the engine's own reported query time (server-side); the client round-trip is reported separately underneath.

| Dataset | Docs | Ingest docs/s | Build s | Index size | Server p50 ms | Server p95 ms | Server p99 ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | 5183 | 1550 | 3.34 | 15.5 MB | 0.00 | 1.00 | 5.00 |

Client round-trip latency (wall-clock around the HTTP call, includes transport and JSON), measured over the same queries and repeats:

| Dataset | Client p50 ms | Client p95 ms | Client p99 ms |
|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | 1.22 | 3.66 | 9.54 |

Server-side time source per dataset:

- beir/scifact/test: response `took` field (integer-millisecond resolution; sub-millisecond searches floor to 0-1 ms)

## Hybrid track

- Setup: BM25 match fused with BBQ dense_vector kNN (full-precision rescore) via the RRF retriever
- Fusion: RRF retriever (rank_constant=60)

Retrieval quality vs human judgements:

| Dataset | nDCG@10 | Recall@100 | MAP | MRR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | 0.7053 | 0.9610 | 0.6587 | 0.6643 |

Operational metrics. Latency below is the engine's own reported query time (server-side); the client round-trip is reported separately underneath.

| Dataset | Docs | Ingest docs/s | Build s | Index size | Server p50 ms | Server p95 ms | Server p99 ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | 5183 | 1479 | 3.50 | 15.5 MB | 0.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |

Client round-trip latency (wall-clock around the HTTP call, includes transport and JSON), measured over the same queries and repeats:

| Dataset | Client p50 ms | Client p95 ms | Client p99 ms |
|---|---|---|---|
| beir/scifact/test | 1.54 | 1.99 | 2.93 |

Server-side time source per dataset:
